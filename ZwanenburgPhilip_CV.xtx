% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\section{Experience/Research}

\runsubsection{McGill University}
\descript{| Graduate Student - PhD Fast-Track}
\location{Sept. 2014 - Present | Montreal, QC}
Goal: Investigation of modern numerical methods for computational fluid dynamics:
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Proved the general equivalence of the Energy Stable Flux Reconstruction and filtered Discontinuous
Galerkin methods (see significant publications).
\item Investigated several aspects relating to curved high-order geometry treatment (see significant publications).
\item Wrote an open-source high-order unstructured compressible Navier-Stokes Discontinuous Galerkin solver (available
on \href{https://github.com/PhilipZwanenburg/DPGSolver}{github}).
\item Currently investigating the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin method.
\item Additional competencies/interests: multiresolution, sum factorization, isogeometric analysis, entropy stability.
